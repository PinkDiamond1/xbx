[wiki:platforms_atmega1284p_16mhz Show all hash functions] 

8 bit microcontroller manufactured by Atmel. RISC design, one of the most powerful 8 bit designs currently
in use. 

128kiB Flash, 16kiB RAM, 16MHz. 

Should create almost the same results as the 1281, with the following differences:[[BR]]
Memory intensive algorithms may run on the 1284P, but not on the 1281, e.g. SHAVITE.
